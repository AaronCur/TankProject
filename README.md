# TankProject
Tank game project completed as one of my second year programming projects. The game was first completed using SFML in c++ and was then
later re-made using the Entity Component System (ECS). In this project i implement a method for the AI Tank to follow the player and
avoiding objects in its way. I later research, test and implement a path finding system for the AI Tank to patrol the level (ECS).
